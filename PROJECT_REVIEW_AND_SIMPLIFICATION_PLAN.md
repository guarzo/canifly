# CanIFly Project Review & Simplification Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive review of the CanIFly codebase with specific recommendations for simplification and improved file path handling to prevent startup crashes.

## üö® Critical Issues: File Path Handling ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED

### Problems Identified

1. ~~**No directory creation at startup**~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
   - ~~The base config directory (`~/.config/canifly`) is never created~~
   - ~~Causes crashes on first run when services attempt to write files~~
   - ~~Location: `internal/server/env.go:58-62`~~
   - **STATUS**: Fixed in `internal/server/env.go:69-77` with directory creation and fallback

2. ~~**Fatal error handling**~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
   - ~~Uses `logger.Fatal()` on secret key generation failure~~
   - ~~Terminates application instead of graceful degradation~~
   - ~~Location: `internal/server/env.go:73`~~
   - **STATUS**: Already returns error instead of fatal

3. ~~**Missing validation**~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
   - ~~No checks for directory existence before file operations~~
   - ~~No fallback paths when primary directories fail~~
   - **STATUS**: Directory creation with fallback implemented

## üì¶ Major Simplification Opportunities

### 1. Service Layer Consolidation

Current architecture has 15+ services with excessive abstraction layers:
- **Interfaces** ‚Üí **Services** ‚Üí **Repositories** ‚Üí **Stores**

#### Proposed Consolidation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Reduce to 5-6 core services:

| New Service | Combines | Responsibility | Status |
|------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| `AccountManagementService` | Account, Character, Association | All account-related operations | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `ConfigurationService` | Config, AppState, Dashboard | Application configuration and state | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `EVEDataService` | ESI, Cache, Character, Skill, EveProfiles | EVE Online data and API interactions | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `StorageService` | All file stores | Unified file persistence layer | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `SyncService` | Sync operations | Settings synchronization | ‚úÖ Already consolidated |

### 2. Remove Unnecessary Abstractions

- Eliminate repository interfaces that only wrap stores
- Direct service-to-store communication
- Reduce from 4-layer to 2-3 layer architecture

### 3. Frontend State Management

Current issues:
- Prop drilling through multiple component levels
- Duplicate data fetching logic (`getAppData` vs `getAppDataNoCache`)
- Complex refresh logic with multiple flags

Solution:
- Implement Zustand for lightweight state management (3KB)
- Create unified authentication state
- Consolidate data fetching patterns

## üîÑ Code Duplication Remediation

### 1. Backend Utilities

Create shared error handling utilities:

```go
// internal/handlers/utils.go
package handlers

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func HandleServiceError(w http.ResponseWriter, logger Logger, err error, action string) {
    logger.Errorf("Failed to %s: %v", action, err)
    respondError(w, fmt.Sprintf("Failed to %s", action), http.StatusInternalServerError)
}

func DecodeAndValidate[T any](r *http.Request, w http.ResponseWriter) (*T, bool) {
    var req T
    if err := decodeJSONBody(r, &req); err != nil {
        respondError(w, "Invalid request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return nil, false
    }
    return &req, true
}
```

### 2. Frontend Custom Hooks

Create reusable async operation hook:

```jsx
// renderer/src/hooks/useAsyncOperation.js
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { toast } from 'react-toastify';

export function useAsyncOperation() {
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);
    
    const execute = useCallback(async (operation, successMessage) => {
        setIsLoading(true);
        setError(null);
        try {
            const result = await operation();
            if (result?.success) {
                toast.success(result.message || successMessage);
            }
            return result;
        } catch (err) {
            setError(err);
            console.error('Operation failed:', err);
            throw err;
        } finally {
            setIsLoading(false);
        }
    }, []);
    
    return { execute, isLoading, error };
}
```

### 3. API Service Simplification

Create helper functions for common request patterns:

```jsx
// renderer/src/api/helpers.js
export function postRequest(endpoint, data, options = {}) {
    return apiRequest(endpoint, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        credentials: 'include',
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    }, options);
}

export function getRequest(endpoint, options = {}) {
    return apiRequest(endpoint, {
        method: 'GET',
        credentials: 'include'
    }, options);
}
```
