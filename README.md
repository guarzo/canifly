## Overview

**Can I Fly** is an application that helps EVE Online players quickly determine which ships their characters can pilot. By integrating with EVE Onlineâ€™s APIs, the tool provides an easy and intuitive interface to view skill plans, training statuses, and ship requirements.

## Features

- **Character Identity Processing:** Fetch and update character information including skills, training queue, and location.
- **Skill Plan Integration:** Determine which skill plans a character has qualified for, is pending, or requires additional training.
- **Mapping & Sync Tools:** Associate EVE accounts and characters with local profiles, syncing settings, and directories.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily select roles, add or remove characters, and adjust skill plans through a simple UI.

## Prerequisites

- **Go:** Version 1.22.3 or newer. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **npm:** Version 22.2.0 or newer.
- **EVE Developer Credentials:**  
  Sign up at [EVE Online Developers](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications) to create an application and obtain:
    - `EVE_CLIENT_ID`
    - `EVE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- **Callback & Secret Key:**  
  Set `EVE_CALLBACK_URL` to the callback URL configured in your EVE developer application.  
  Generate a secret key for encryption:
  ```sh
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
  Use this output as `SECRET_KEY`
